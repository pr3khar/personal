            We could approach this in two ways:
            <br /><br />
            1. A virtual reality app to simulate crowd and allow for different
            settings(locations). The user will have the ability to modify
            crowdâ€™s noise and other factors along with other disturbances. It
            could also provides a summary of speech along with accuracy and pain
            points upon completion.
            <br /><br />
            2. Given the rise in virtual meetings and conferences, integrating a
            speech training emulator in a video conferencing tool with all the
            features mentioned above (participant size, background disturbance,
            etc.) while simultaneously providing insights of the speech could
            make up a well-rounded learning & practice system.

            Some in-depth interviews were conducted to evaluate these ideas. We
            got the following insights:
            <br /><br />
            Practicing using a video-conferencing tool could be pretty effective
            specifically for those not accustomed to using those tools. Whereas
            some had concerns regarding whether if it would be able to replicate
            a real-time situation. But overall, we got a positive response
            regarding the speech training simulator, in particular, they felt
            that the video conferencing one was more useful while VR approach
            seemed exciting and fun to try.
            <br /><br />
            For the wearable one, the general consensus was that a wearable
            might make them conscious and hence, disrupt the natural flow of the
            conversation. Some had concerns regarding their appearance and the
            fact it had to look gender neutral for them to wear it at all times.
            Whereas some felt that their wrist was already full with their watch
            and wouldnâ€™t want to wear an additional device. Plus, due to the all
            those sensors, the necklace could be heavy and look weird. On top of
            all this, most of the interviewees also felt uncomfortable knowing
            the fact that the device would be hearing them all the fault and had
            privacy concerns.
            <br /><br />
            Based on these insights, we decided to go forward with designing a
            speech training simulator.

            through our research, we found that words spoken per minute plays an
            intergral part in the outcome of speech. So, we integrated an
            odometer with a range of 1 to 300. Our research shows that the range
            is b/w 1 to 300, with 160 being the maximum someone is comfortable
            hearing. The ideal range would be 140-160 as it would convey the
            information efficiently without any problems.

            sentiment also plays a crucial in how your words are interpreted, we
            found a google api that analyses the sentiment of the speech and
            used an odometer to depict it. we used emojis ðŸ˜¡ & ðŸ˜ƒ have been used
            at the ends of the odometer for fun & easy recognition.

            different types of audiences and their behaviour has the capacity to
            dictate the outcome of various speeches. Hence, the option to switch
            between variable crowd sizes and crowd volumes would allow the user
            to test themselves in a variety of conditions and situations to
            provides a comprehensive experience.
