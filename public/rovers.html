          Being a student myself, I find managing my expenses and outings to be
          a vital aspect of my daily life. I am often found switching between
          various applications to keep a check on my expenditure and track my
          plans. This inspired me to design a solution to efficiently manage
          budgets and plans.

            This space has grown massively in the past few years, specifically

            places, meeting people, travelling and exploring, even solo. Hence,
            naturally, this is an integral component in planning expenses and

            the sense that they realise they need of using a tool to help them
            solve their issues, in this case, their budget and expense

            Apart from the major issues like having to juggle multiple
            applications to achieve the common goal of managing personal

            #1 Most of people feel that splitting expenses and their budget
            management go hand-in-hand, but there are no apps that offer both of
            them together, hence, it is cumbersome and irritating.
          </div>
          <div class="normal">
            When talking about budget & expenses, specifically for this age
            group, things like settlements due, routine expenses, events, plans
            and outings are integral to it. Even though there are applications
            there to deal with the different aspects of it, there is none that
            offers a solution to all of them in one application.

            People of this age, have many shared expenses and the thing with
            shared expenses, specifically among friends is that they are usually
            like they will pay later, but they end up forgetting about it. Even
            while using bill-splitting applications, they tend to not care and
            not settle their dues for long.

            People are usually sensitive when it comes to money, specifically
            when there is some form of a relationship between the two parties.

            In many cases, users are much more casual in terms of how they
            manage and spend their money in the first half of the month than
            second, which translates to them cancelling out on plans and

          As the approach taken by many companies, offering some sort of reward
          for the completion of a task does impact the behaviour of the user.
          So, I thought of using a similar system to gamify the entire
          experience. Users can be provided with rover coin whenever they settle
          their due in time or keep up with their budget, or upload proof of
          their transaction.

          <div class="normal-2">
            As users collect rover coins, they can spend them on the products
            available at the rover store. This, apart from inspiring users to
            develop a habit to settle their dues and record their expenses on
            time, would also offer a premium experience making them feel
            appreciated and rewarded.
