          I worked as an intern at Wetlands International South Asia for a

          I began my work by establishing design guidelines, specifically the
          colour palette and the typeface. For the colour palette, I was asked
          to continue with the companyâ€™s colour schemes and palette. For the
          typeface, I chose Inter, a clean and minimal Sans-Serif typeface,
          offering excellent readability.

          The next step was creating a user flow. I wanted the website to be
          user friendly and intuitive. On the landing page, I added a CTA for
          Submission and also links for all the other important sections. Each
          event was allocated separate which helped in containing an overflow of
          information for the user. All the sub-pages had detailed breadcrumbs
          to help the user navigate through the website easily.

          <span id="step">Step 3: </span>Designing the interface
        </div>

        <p id="reg-text">
          Now with all the base-work done, I had to design the interface. The
          supervisors overlooking the project asked me to keep it minimal and
          clean. So, for the landing page, I opted for a beautiful photograph of
          an Indian wetland, which offered striking colours and also did justice
          to the organisationâ€™s goal and area of service. All the sections were
          designed with the main purpose of creating a smooth and seamless
          experience.

        <p id="reg-text">
          The illustrations for the events were chosen keeping in mind the
          target audience and the nature of the event. To restrict an overflow
          of information, the FAQ section was designed as an accordion. Some
          micro-interacrtions were added to make it seem interactive and fun.
          Text bodies through the website were restricted to certain width with
          sufficient white space to make it readable and to prevent the user
          from getting tired.

        <div class="text-header">
          <span id="step">Step 4: </span>Development
        </div>

        <p id="reg-text">
          For the development part, I coded the front-end using HTML5, CSS3 and
          some vanilla JavaScript, while my team-mate and good friend,
          <a href="https://www.abhinrustagi.xyz">Abhin Rustagi</a> worked on the
          back-end, form handling and database management. Overall the
          development of the website took 2 weeks and the submission process was
          tested thoroughly before going live with the project.
